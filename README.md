prolog_library_ideas
====================

Random ideas about libraries for Prolog

See each `.md` file for details.  Once an idea has been implemented, I delete the file because it's visible on my [list of packs](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?author=michael@ndrix.org&sort=downloads).

There are also many good ideas and implementations at [The public-domain Prolog library](http://www.j-paine.org/prolog/library.html).  Many of those would be excellent to release as packs or build on for packs (with permission, of course).
