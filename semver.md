# Semantic Versions

Store and compare [semantic version numbers](http://semver.org).  They have well-defined semantics and should be useful when working with packs or other version numbers since they pretty much describe how people use version numbers when releasing software.

With the library, one should be able to:

  * create only valid version number data structures
  * compare two version numbers for precedence
  * display version numbers as strings
  * parse version number strings into data structures
  * ask whether the API for two version numbers is compatible
